 - Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne is connected to France via the relationship country.
Please determine the diameter of this network and output the corresponding path in the following format: [Entity1, Entity2, ..., EntityN].

## Response: 
### Claude3-haiku:
[Seine-et-Marne, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne, France, Montereau-Fault-Yonne]
### Deepseek-V2:
To calculate the diameter of the given knowledge graph, we need to find the longest shortest path between any two nodes. The graph consists of the following entities and relationships:

1. Seine-et-Marne is connected to Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne via the relationship department.
2. Seine-et-Marne is connected to Montereau-Fault-Yonne via the relationship department.
3. Seine-et-Marne is connected to France via the relationship country.
4. Montereau-Fault-Yonne is connected to France via the relationship country.
5. Vittorio De Sica is connected to France via the relationship deathPlace.
6. Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne is connected to France via the relationship country.

From these relationships, we can deduce the following paths:

- Seine-et-Marne to Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne (1 step)
- Seine-et-Marne to Montereau-Fault-Yonne (1 step)
- Seine-et-Marne to France (1 step)
- Montereau-Fault-Yonne to France (1 step)
- Vittorio De Sica to France (1 step)
- Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne to France (1 step)

The longest shortest path in this graph is 1 step, as all entities are directly connected to each other or to France. Therefore, the diameter of the graph is 1.

The corresponding path for the diameter is: [Seine-et-Marne, France]
### Gemma-7b:
[Seine-et-Marne, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne, France]
### GPT-3.5:
[Seine-et-Marne, France, Vittorio De Sica]
### GPT-4o:
The given knowledge graph consists of the following entities and relationships:

- **Entities**: Seine-et-Marne, Montereau-Fault-Yonne, Vittorio De Sica, Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne, France
- **Relationships**:
  - Seine-et-Marne is connected to Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne (department).
  - Seine-et-Marne is connected to Montereau-Fault-Yonne (department).
  - Seine-et-Marne is connected to France (country).
  - Montereau-Fault-Yonne is connected to France (country).
  - Vittorio De Sica is connected to France (deathPlace).
  - Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne is connected to France (country).

First, let's visualize the graph:

- Seine-et-Marne is directly connected to:
  - Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne
  - Montereau-Fault-Yonne
  - France

- Montereau-Fault-Yonne is directly connected to:
  - Seine-et-Marne
  - France

- Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne is directly connected to:
  - Seine-et-Marne
  - France

- Vittorio De Sica is directly connected to:
  - France

- France is directly connected to:
  - Seine-et-Marne
  - Montereau-Fault-Yonne
  - Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne
  - Vittorio De Sica

Now, we will determine the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes and find the longest of these shortest paths to determine the diameter of the graph.

The graph can be represented as follows:

- Seine-et-Marne ↔ Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne
- Seine-et-Marne ↔ Montereau-Fault-Yonne
- Seine-et-Marne ↔ France
- Montereau-Fault-Yonne ↔ France
- Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne ↔ France
- Vittorio De Sica ↔ France

Given the connections, the shortest paths between nodes are:

- Seine-et-Marne to Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne: 1 edge
- Seine-et-Marne to Montereau-Fault-Yonne: 1 edge
- Seine-et-Marne to France: 1 edge
- Montereau-Fault-Yonne to France: 1 edge
- Saint-Fiacre Seine-et-Marne to France: 1 edge
- Vittorio De Sica to France: 1 edge

By analyzing the shortest paths, it is clear that the longest shortest path is between Vittorio De Sica and any other node except France, which is 2 edges long, such as:

[Vittorio De Sica, France, Montereau-Fault-Yonne]

Thus, the diameter of the graph is [2], and one of the paths corresponding to the diameter is:

[Vittorio De Sica, France, Montereau-Fault-Yonne]
### Llama3-70b:
[Seine-et-Marne, Montereau-Fault-Yonne, France, Vittorio De Sica]
### Llama3-8b:
To calculate the diameter of the graph, we need to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes and then determine the maximum length of these shortest paths.

After analyzing the relationships between the entities in the Seine-et-Marne graph, we can identify the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes:

* Seine-et-Marne to Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne: [Seine-et-Marne, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne] (distance 1)
* Seine-et-Marne to Montereau-Fault-Yonne: [Seine-et-Marne, Montereau-Fault-Yonne] (distance 1)
* Seine-et-Marne to France: [Seine-et-Marne, France] (distance 1)
* Montereau-Fault-Yonne to France: [Montereau-Fault-Yonne, France] (distance 1)
* Vittorio De Sica to France: [Vittorio De Sica, France] (distance 1)
* Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne to France: [Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne, France] (distance 1)

The maximum distance between any pair of nodes is 1, which means the diameter of the graph is 1.

The corresponding path for the diameter is: [Seine-et-Marne, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne, France]
### Mixtral-7x8b:
 The diameter of this network is 3, and the corresponding path is: [Seine-et-Marne, Montereau-Fault-Yonne, France, Vittorio De Sica]
### Qwen1.5-72b:
The diameter of this network is 3. One possible shortest path corresponding to the diameter is: [Seine-et-Marne, Vittorio De Sica, France, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne]
### Qwen1.5-7b:
The diameter of this knowledge graph can be calculated by finding the shortest path between all pairs of entities and then finding the maximum length. Here's the path with the maximum length:

[Vittorio De Sica, France, Seine-et-Marne, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne, France, Montereau-Fault-Yonne, France]

This path corresponds to the longest distance between any pair of entities in the graph. Therefore, the diameter is 6. The output format would be:

[Vittorio De Sica, France, Seine-et-Marne, Saint-Fiacre  Seine-et-Marne, France, Montereau-Fault-Yonne, France]

# Task: GED

## Problem: 
You are required to solve the Graph Edit Distance problem between two molecules. Each edit operation (adding or deleting an edge, adding or deleting an isolated node, or relabeling a node) has the identity cost. Your objective is to establish a mapping between the atom IDs from Molecule A to Molecule B, ensuring that each atom ID in Molecule A corresponds to exactly one atom ID in Molecule B. The mapping corresponds to the minimum edit cost between the two graphs.

**Example 1**

Molecule A:
- Atoms: N (atom 0), O (atom 1), Si (atom 2), O (atom 3), O (atom 4).
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 2-4.
Molecule B:
- Atoms: F (atom 0), B (atom 1), C (atom 2), N (atom 3), Br (atom 4).
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-4, 2-3.

One optimal node mapping: [3, 2, 1, 0, 4].

**Problem to Solve**

You are given the following two molecules:
Molecule A:
- Atoms: N (atom 0), C (atom 1), N (atom 2), F (atom 3).
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3.
Molecule B:
- Atoms: O (atom 0), C (atom 1), F (atom 2), F (atom 3).
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3.
Represent the node mapping as a list of integers, where the position in the list corresponds to the atom ID in Molecule A and the value at that position indicates the corresponding atom ID in Molecule B.
For instance, if atom 0 in Molecule A corresponds to atom 1 in Molecule B, atom 1 in Molecule A corresponds to atom 0 in Molecule B, and atom 2 remains unchanged, the mapping would be represented as [1, 0, 2, ...].

## Response: 
### Claude3-haiku:
[2, 1, 0, 3]
### Deepseek-V2:
To solve the Graph Edit Distance problem for the given molecules, we need to find the optimal mapping that minimizes the edit cost. Here are the steps to find the optimal mapping:

1. **Identify the atoms and their labels in both molecules**:
   - Molecule A: N (atom 0), C (atom 1), N (atom 2), F (atom 3)
   - Molecule B: O (atom 0), C (atom 1), F (atom 2), F (atom 3)

2. **Analyze the bonds in both molecules**:
   - Molecule A: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3
   - Molecule B: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3

3. **Find the optimal mapping**:
   - Atom 0 in Molecule A (N) can map to atom 1 in Molecule B (C) or atom 0 in Molecule B (O). Mapping to atom 1 (C) aligns better with the bond structure.
   - Atom 1 in Molecule A (C) can map to atom 0 in Molecule B (C) or atom 1 in Molecule B (C). Mapping to atom 0 (C) aligns with the bond structure.
   - Atom 2 in Molecule A (N) can map to atom 2 in Molecule B (F) or atom 3 in Molecule B (F). Mapping to atom 2 (F) aligns with the bond structure.
   - Atom 3 in Molecule A (F) can map to atom 2 in Molecule B (F) or atom 3 in Molecule B (F). Mapping to atom 3 (F) aligns with the bond structure.

4. **Final mapping**:
   - The optimal mapping that maintains the bond structure and minimizes the edit cost is:
     [1, 0, 2, 3]

This mapping ensures that each atom ID in Molecule A corresponds to exactly one atom ID in Molecule B, and the bond structure is preserved as much as possible, minimizing the edit cost.
### Gemma-7b:
[1, 0, 2, 3]
### GPT-3.5:
The graph edit distance problem can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal node mapping between the two molecules. First, construct the cost matrix where the cost of matching atom i in Molecule A with atom j in Molecule B is the edit distance between the two atoms. Then, use the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal assignment that minimizes the total cost.

For the given molecules:
Molecule A:
- Atoms: N (atom 0), C (atom 1), N (atom 2), F (atom 3).
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3.
Molecule B:
- Atoms: O (atom 0), C (atom 1), F (atom 2), F (atom 3).
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3.

The cost matrix is:
```
| 1 0 1 1 |
| 0 1 0 0 |
| 1 0 1 1 |
| 1 0 1 1 |
```
Using the Hungarian algorithm, the optimal node mapping is:
[1, 2, 0, 3]
### GPT-4o:
For the given problem of finding the Graph Edit Distance between two molecules with the provided data:

**Molecule A:**
- Atoms: N (atom 0), C (atom 1), N (atom 2), F (atom 3)
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3

**Molecule B:**
- Atoms: O (atom 0), C (atom 1), F (atom 2), F (atom 3)
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3

We need to find the optimal mapping of atoms from Molecule A to Molecule B that minimizes the edit distance. Considering the costs and the nature of atoms and bonds, the optimal mapping that aligns the most similar atoms and bond structures would be as follows:

[0, 1, 3, 2]

This means:
- Atom 0 in Molecule A (N) maps to atom 0 in Molecule B (O)
- Atom 1 in Molecule A (C) maps to atom 1 in Molecule B (C)
- Atom 2 in Molecule A (N) maps to atom 3 in Molecule B (F)
- Atom 3 in Molecule A (F) maps to atom 2 in Molecule B (F)

So the optimal node mapping is [0, 1, 3, 2]
### Llama3-70b:
[0, 1, 2, 3]
### Llama3-8b:
[Molecule A: N (atom 0), C (atom 1), N (atom 2), F (atom 3)]
[Molecule B: O (atom 0), C (atom 1), F (atom 2), F (atom 3)]

One optimal node mapping: [1, 1, 2, 2].
### Mixtral-7x8b:
 The node mapping between Molecule A and Molecule B that minimizes the Graph Edit Distance is [1, 0, 3, 2]. Here's the reasoning:

- Atom 0 (N) in Molecule A corresponds to Atom 1 (C) in Molecule B.
- Atom 1 (C) in Molecule A corresponds to Atom 0 (O) in Molecule B.
- Atom 2 (N) in Molecule A corresponds to Atom 3 (F) in Molecule B.
- Atom 3 (F) in Molecule A remains unchanged, as there is no better match in Molecule B.
### Qwen1.5-72b:
An optimal node mapping for the given molecules is [2, 1, 0, 3].
### Qwen1.5-7b:
The node mapping for the given example is [1, 0, 2, 3].

# Task: MCS

## Problem: 
You are required to solve the Maximum Common Subgraph problem. Your goal is to identify the common subgraph with the maximum number of atoms shared between the two molecules.

**Example 1**

Molecule A consists of 8 atoms with the following 9 bonds:
0-1, 0-6, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 3-7, 4-5, 5-6, 5-7.
Molecule B consists of 7 atoms with the following 7 bonds:
0-1, 1-2, 1-4, 2-3, 3-4, 3-6, 4-5.

One max common subgraph: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6].

**Problem to Solve**

You are given the following two molecules:
Molecule A consists of 4 atoms with the following 3 bonds:
0-1, 1-2, 2-3.
Molecule B consists of 4 atoms with the following 3 bonds:
0-1, 1-2, 1-3.
Provide the indices of the atoms in the common subgraph for each molecule in the following format: [Node indices in molecular A], [Node indices in molecular B].
For example, if the common subgraph is the subgraph of atom 1, 2, 3 in molecule A and the subgrah of atom 2, 3, 4 in molecule B, you should answer: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

## Response: 
### Claude3-haiku:
[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
### Deepseek-V2:
[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
### Gemma-7b:
[1, 2, 3], [2, 3]
### GPT-3.5:
[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]
### GPT-4o:
The maximum common subgraph between Molecule A and Molecule B with the given bonds can be determined as follows:

Molecule A:
- Atoms: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3

Molecule B:
- Atoms: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3

The common subgraph can be identified by comparing the structures of both molecules to find the largest matching substructure. The bonds 0-1 and 1-2 in Molecule A and Molecule B are identical and form a linear subgraph.

Thus, the maximum common subgraph is:
- For Molecule A: Atoms 0, 1, 2
- For Molecule B: Atoms 0, 1, 2

Therefore, the solution is: [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
### Llama3-70b:
[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]
### Llama3-8b:
[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]
### Mixtral-7x8b:
 The maximum common subgraph for the given molecules can be obtained by comparing the bonds between atoms in both molecules. By identifying the shared bonds and their connecting atoms, we can derive the common subgraph.

For the given molecules:
Molecule A: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3
Molecule B: 0-1, 1-2, 1-3

The maximum common subgraph is:
[1, 2], [2, 1, 3]

Explanation:
- Atom 1 in molecule A and atom 2 in molecule B are connected to each other.
- Atom 2 in molecule A and atom 1 in molecule B are connected to each other.
- Atom 2 in molecule A and atom 3 in molecule B are connected to each other through atom 1 in molecule B.
- Atom 3 in molecule A is not connected to any atom in molecule B, but since atom 2 in molecule A is connected to atom 3 in molecule B, atom 3 in molecule A is also part of the common subgraph.

Therefore, the maximum common subgraph is formed by atoms [1, 2] in molecule A and atoms [2, 1, 3] in molecule B.
### Qwen1.5-72b:
The common subgraph between Molecule A and Molecule B includes atoms that are connected by a path of bonds that exists in both molecules. In this case, the common subgraph consists of atoms 0, 1, and 2, as these atoms are bonded together in both molecules.

Solution: [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2].
### Qwen1.5-7b:

# Task: MIS

## Problem: 
Your task is to solve the Maximum Independent Set problem in the given social network. In this network, each node represents a user, and each edge represents a friendship connection. You need to identify the largest subset of users such that no two users in this subset are friends connected by an edge. 

**Example 1**

- Users in the network: Melinda Vaughan, Mary Thornton, Jeremiah Griffith, Lisa Anderson, Alfred Powell.
- Fiendship connections: Melinda Vaughan and Jeremiah Griffith, Mary Thornton and Jeremiah Griffith, Jeremiah Griffith and Lisa Anderson, Jeremiah Griffith and Alfred Powell.
One Maximum Independent Set: [Melinda Vaughan, Lisa Anderson, Alfred Powell, Mary Thornton].

**Problem to Solve**

- Users in the network: William Lawson, Daniel Shelton, Michelle Lewis, Julie Hayes.
- Fiendship connections: William Lawson and Daniel Shelton, William Lawson and Julie Hayes, Michelle Lewis and Julie Hayes.

Identify the Maximum Independent Set of this network and present your answer in the following format: [UserA, UserB, UserC, UserD, ...].

## Response: 
### Claude3-haiku:
[William Lawson, Michelle Lewis]
### Deepseek-V2:

### GPT-4o:
To solve the Maximum Independent Set problem for the given social network, we need to identify the largest subset of users such that no two users in this subset are friends (i.e., there are no edges between any two nodes in this subset).

Let's list the users and their friendship connections:

**Users:**
- William Lawson
- Daniel Shelton
- Michelle Lewis
- Julie Hayes

**Friendship Connections:**
- William Lawson and Daniel Shelton
- William Lawson and Julie Hayes
- Michelle Lewis and Julie Hayes

First, let's create a visual representation of the network:

- William Lawson (connected to Daniel Shelton and Julie Hayes)
- Daniel Shelton (connected to William Lawson)
- Michelle Lewis (connected to Julie Hayes)
- Julie Hayes (connected to William Lawson and Michelle Lewis)

Now, we can see the connections:
```
William Lawson - Daniel Shelton
William Lawson - Julie Hayes
Michelle Lewis - Julie Hayes
```

To identify the Maximum Independent Set, we need to select the largest group of users such that no two users are directly connected.

### Possible Sets:

1. **Set 1**: William Lawson, Michelle Lewis
   - William Lawson is not connected to Michelle Lewis.

2. **Set 2**: Daniel Shelton, Michelle Lewis
   - Daniel Shelton is not connected to Michelle Lewis.

3. **Set 3**: Daniel Shelton, Julie Hayes
   - Daniel Shelton is not connected to Julie Hayes.

4. **Set 4**: Michelle Lewis
   - Only one user, trivially independent.

From these sets, Set 2 and Set 3 both include 2 users, making them candidates for the Maximum Independent Set.

Thus, one possible Maximum Independent Set is:
[Daniel Shelton, Michelle Lewis]

Alternatively, another valid Maximum Independent Set is:
[Daniel Shelton, Julie Hayes]

Therefore, the Maximum Independent Set can be presented as [Daniel Shelton, Michelle Lewis] or [Daniel Shelton, Julie Hayes].
### Llama3-70b:
[Michelle Lewis, Daniel Shelton]
### Llama3-8b:
The Maximum Independent Set of this network is: [William Lawson, Michelle Lewis, Daniel Shelton].
### Mixtral-7x8b:
 [William Lawson, Michelle Lewis, Julie Hayes] or [Daniel Shelton, Michelle Lewis, Julie Hayes]

Explanation: Both sets {William Lawson, Michelle Lewis, Julie Hayes} and {Daniel Shelton, Michelle Lewis, Julie Hayes} are maximum independent sets for this network, as they each contain three users with no friendship connections between them.

### GPT-4o:
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) aims to find the shortest possible route that visits each airport exactly once and returns to the starting point. Given the distances between the airports, we can determine the shortest route by examining the various permutations and selecting the one with the minimum distance. Here is the detailed process:

Airports to visit: YNT, TEB, CFC, VIE, NSH, ROV

Travel distances between each pair of airports:

- YNT to VIE: 7962 km
- YNT to ROV: 6644 km
- YNT to NSH: 6176 km
- YNT to CFC: 18668 km
- YNT to TEB: 12263 km
- TEB to VIE: 6987 km
- TEB to ROV: 8529 km
- TEB to NSH: 10389 km
- TEB to CFC: 8846 km
- CFC to VIE: 10716 km
- CFC to ROV: 12244 km
- CFC to NSH: 13193 km
- VIE to ROV: 1736 km
- VIE to NSH: 3406 km
- NSH to ROV: 3000 km

To find the shortest tour, we need to consider all permutations of the routes and calculate their total distances, then select the one with the minimum distance.

After evaluating all possible permutations, the shortest route with the minimum total distance is:

[YNT, NSH, ROV, VIE, TEB, CFC, YNT]

This route ensures each airport is visited exactly once, and it returns to the starting point (YNT), minimizing the total travel distance.
