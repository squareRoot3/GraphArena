Essentially, this means selecting the minimum number of users so that every friendship is covered by at least one person in our selected set.\n\nHere\u2019s how we approach this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Network**: First, we need to visualize or at least understand the relationships among the users. This involves listing all the nodes (users) and edges (friendships).\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: Users are nodes, and friendships are edges. Our graph looks something like this:\n    - Valerie Williams connects to Gary Walters, Matthew Bush, and Dr. Jeremy Williams Jr.\n    - Jessica Rodriguez connects to Gary Walters.\n    - Terri Lambert connects to Tamara Huff and Dr. Jeremy Williams Jr.\n    - Dr. Jeremy Williams Jr. connects to Tamara Huff, Nicole Caldwell, Miguel Price, and Bradley Donaldson.\n    - Jason Baker connects to Gary Walters.\n    - Tamara Huff connects to Nicole Caldwell, Miguel Price, and Bradley Donaldson.\n    - Bradley Donaldson connects to Miguel Price.\n    - Nicole Caldwell connects to Miguel Price.\n\n3. **Approach for Minimum Vertex Cover**: We need to pick the smallest number of nodes such that every edge is incident to at least one selected node.

We select Dr. Jeremy Williams Jr.\n    - Tamara Huff is also well connected, covering connections with Nicole Caldwell, Miguel Price, Bradley Donaldson, Terri Lambert, and Dr. Jeremy Williams Jr. We select Tamara Huff.\n    - Since Valerie Williams also connects to multiple nodes, we consider her.
