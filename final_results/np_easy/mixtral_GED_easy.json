Find the minimum weight perfect matching in G using the Hungarian algorithm.\n\nFollowing these steps, we obtain the following minimum weight perfect matching:\n\n- 0 (N in A) is matched to 3 (N in B) with weight 1 (same atom type)\n- 1 (P in A) is matched to 1 (S in B) with weight 2 (different atom types, not adjacent)\n- 2 (F in A) is matched to 2 (C in B) with weight 2 (different atom types, not adjacent)\n- 3 (O in A) is matched to 0 (O in B) with weight 1 (same atom type)\n\nThe node mapping is represented as a list of integers: [3, 1, 2, 0]."}, "494": {"mixtral": " The node mapping that minimizes the graph edit distance between the given molecules is [6, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 0].\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n- Atom 0 in Molecule A (C) is mapped to atom 6 in Molecule B (O).\n- Atom 1 in Molecule A (C) is mapped to atom 1 in Molecule B (C).\n- Atom 2 in Molecule A (O) is mapped to atom 2 in Molecule B (C).\n- Atom 3 in Molecule A (C) is mapped to atom 0 in Molecule B (O).\n- Atom 4 in Molecule A (N) is mapped to atom 3 in Molecule B (C).\n- Atom 5 in Molecule A (C) is mapped to atom 1 in Molecule B (C).\n- Atom 6 in Molecule A (C) is mapped to atom 0 in Molecule B (O).\n\nThis mapping ensures that each atom in Molecule A corresponds to exactly one atom in Molecule B, and the total edit cost is minimized."}, "495": {"mixtral": " The Graph Edit Distance problem between the two given molecules can be solved by considering all possible mappings and choosing the one with the minimum cost. However, since the identity cost is 1 for each edit operation, we can simplify the problem by trying to find a mapping that minimizes the number of edit operations.\n\nIn this case, we can observe that the best approach is to map the atoms in Molecule A to atoms in Molecule B with the same number of bonds. This results in the following mapping:\n\nCl (atom 0 in Molecule A) -> C (atom 0 in Molecule B)\nC (atom 1 in Molecule A) -> N (atom 1 in Molecule B)\nC (atom 2 in Molecule A) -> C (atom 2 in Molecule B)\nO (atom 3 in Molecule A) -> None (delete atom and bond)\nC (atom 4 in Molecule A) -> C (atom 3 in Molecule B)\nC (atom 5 in Molecule A) -> C (atom 4 in Molecule B)\nO (atom 6 in Molecule A) -> C (atom 5 in Molecule B)\n\nSince atom 3 in Molecule A has no corresponding atom in Molecule B with the same number of bonds, we delete this atom and its bond. The remaining atoms are mapped accordingly.\n\nThe node mapping can be represented as a list of integers: [0, 1, 2, -1, 3, 4, 5].
