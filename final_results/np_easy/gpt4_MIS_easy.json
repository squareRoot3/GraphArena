Therefore, Adam Moore cannot be included in the Maximum Independent Set.\n2. With Adam Moore excluded, consider the remaining users and their connections:\n   - **Tony Brown** is connected to Jill Roberts (but not to Natalie Woods or Michael Henderson).\n   - **Natalie Woods** has no other connections when Adam Moore is excluded.\n   - **Jill Roberts** is only connected to Tony Brown when Adam Moore is excluded.\n   - **Michael Henderson** has no other connections when Adam Moore is excluded.\n3.
