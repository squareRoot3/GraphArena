We can achieve this by employing a graph traversal algorithm, such as breadth-first search (BFS), to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes and then finding the maximum length among these paths.\n\nHere's how we can approach it:\n\n1. Initialize the diameter variable to 0.\n2. For each node in the graph, perform a BFS to find the shortest paths to all other nodes.\n3. For each pair of nodes, update the diameter if the shortest path between them is longer than the current diameter.\n4.

Start with a node, traverse the graph using BFS, and compute the shortest paths to all other nodes.\n2. Repeat this process for each node.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length found among all the shortest paths, which will be the diameter of the graph.\n\nConsidering the provided knowledge graph and relationships, we would implement the steps mentioned above to find the diameter.
