We'll start by constructing the graph using the friendship connections provided, then we'll traverse the graph to find the connected components.\n\nLet's go step by step:\n\n1. **Construct the Graph**: We'll represent the social network as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix, where each node represents a person, and edges represent friendships between them.\n\n2. **Traverse the Graph**: We'll use DFS or BFS to explore all nodes and their connections, marking visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n\n3. **Identify Connected Components**: During traversal, we'll identify groups of nodes that are connected to each other. Each group represents a connected component.\n\n4. **Output One Representative Node from Each Component**: For each connected component, we'll output one node as a representative. This can be any node within the component.\n\nLet's apply this approach to the given problem:\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Graph**:\nWe'll represent the graph using an adjacency list.\n\n```\n{\n  \"Tabitha Alvarez\": [\"Sarah Mayo\"],\n  \"Patricia Ramirez\": [\"Sarah Mayo\"],\n  \"Michael Mcgee Jr.\": [\"Sarah Mayo\"],\n  \"Dana Oliver\": [\"Carrie Saunders\"],\n  \"Carrie Saunders\": [\"Robin Turner\", \"Jessica Barron\", \"Benjamin Henry\", \"Sheila Webb\", \"Brian Baker\", \"Dana Oliver\"],\n  \"Christina Whitehead\": [\"Sarah Mayo\"],\n  \"Amanda Rice\": [\"Allen Mccoy\", \"Theresa Hernandez\"],\n  \"Theresa Hernandez\": [\"Amanda Rice\", \"Allen Mccoy\"],\n  \"Sarah Mayo\": [\"Tabitha Alvarez\", \"Patricia Ramirez\", \"Michael Mcgee Jr.\", \"Anne Thomas\", \"Christina Whitehead\"],\n  \"Benjamin Henry\": [\"Brian Baker\", \"Carrie Saunders\"],\n  \"Brian Baker\": [\"Benjamin Henry\", \"Amanda Rice\"],\n  \"Robin Turner\": [\"Carrie Saunders\"],\n  \"Jessica Barron\": [\"Carrie Saunders\"],\n  \"Anne Thomas\": [\"Sarah Mayo\"],\n  \"Sheila Webb\": [\"Carrie Saunders\"],\n  \"Allen Mccoy\": [\"Amanda Rice\", \"Theresa Hernandez\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Traverse the Graph**:\nWe'll start traversing from each node and explore its connections.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Connected Components**:\nBased on the traversal, we'll identify the groups of connected nodes.\n\n**Step 4: Output One Representative Node from Each Component**:\nFor each group of connected nodes, we'll output one representative node.\n\nThe identified connected components and their representative nodes are as follows:\n\n```\n[Tabitha Alvarez, Patricia Ramirez, Michael Mcgee Jr., Sarah Mayo, Anne Thomas, Christina Whitehead]\n[Dana Oliver, Carrie Saunders, Robin Turner, Jessica Barron, Benjamin Henry, Sheila Webb, Brian Baker, Amanda Rice, Theresa Hernandez, Allen Mccoy]\n```\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```\n[Tabitha Alvarez, Dana Oliver]\n```"}, "89": {"gpt4": "The connected components in the given social network can be identified as follows:\n\n1.
