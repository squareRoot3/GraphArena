In this case, the edit operations include adding or deleting edges, adding or deleting isolated nodes, and relabeling nodes.\n\nTo solve the problem for the given molecules, we need to find the optimal node mapping that minimizes the edit cost between the two graphs. This can be achieved by considering all possible mappings and calculating the cost for each mapping.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, it is not feasible to provide the exact optimal node mapping without executing code. The optimal node mapping can be found using graph matching algorithms such as the Hungarian algorithm, VF2 algorithm, or other graph isomorphism algorithms.\n\nTherefore, the optimal node mapping for the given molecules can be obtained by implementing a graph matching algorithm to find the minimum edit cost and corresponding node mapping.\n\n[Please use a graph matching algorithm to find the optimal node mapping and minimum edit cost between the two molecules.]"}, "471": {"gpt": "[2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"}, "472": {"gpt": "[1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0]"}, "473": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 5, 3, 4, 2, 6, 7, 10, 9, 8]"}, "474": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"}, "475": {"gpt": "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"}, "476": {"gpt": "[0, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 4, 13]"}, "477": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 9, 8, 3]"}, "478": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11]"}, "479": {"gpt": "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"}, "480": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 9]"}, "481": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 7, 0, 5, 6, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"}, "482": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"}, "483": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]"}, "484": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0]"}, "485": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"}, "486": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5, 10, 11]"}, "487": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 7]"}, "488": {"gpt": "[1, 3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"}, "489": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"}, "490": {"gpt": "[1, 7, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 8, 10, 9]"}, "491": {"gpt": "[1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]"}, "492": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8]"}, "493": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"}, "494": {"gpt": "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 8]"}, "495": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 11, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 10, 0, 13]"}, "496": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"}, "497": {"gpt": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9, 0]"}, "498": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"}, "499": {"gpt": "[1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"}}
