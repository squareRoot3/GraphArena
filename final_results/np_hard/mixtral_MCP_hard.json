Start by finding all the collaborations involving Svebor Karaman, as he has the most collaborations and thus can potentially be part of a large clique.\n2. Identify the other authors involved in these collaborations: Tinne Tuytelaars, Ross B. Girshick, Jorge S\u00e1nchez, Bastian Leibe, Krystian Mikolajczyk, Jenny Benois-Pineau, Andrew Zisserman, and Cordelia Schmid.\n3. Check for collaborations between these authors. They all have collaborations with each other, forming a clique.\n4. This is the largest clique possible, as adding any other author would result in breaking the clique property (i.e., not every pair of vertices in the subset is connected by an edge)."}, "498": {"mixtral": " [Timothy R.
