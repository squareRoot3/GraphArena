The algorithm iteratively selects nodes that are not adjacent to each other until no such nodes remain.\n\n3. **Pseudocode**:\n   - Initialize an empty set as the maximum independent set (MIS).\n   - Iterate over all nodes in the graph.\n   - For each node, if it is not adjacent to any node already in the MIS, add it to the MIS.\n   - Repeat until no more nodes can be added.\n\n4. **Analysis**: This greedy algorithm may not always produce the optimal solution, but it provides a reasonable approximation in most cases. The time complexity of this approach is O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices.\n\n5. **Application**: Apply the algorithm to the given social network graph to identify the Maximum Independent Set.\n\n6. **Solution**:\n   - Users in the network: Kyle Austin, Aaron Bright, Wanda Mejia, Eric Murphy, Kimberly Foster, Gregory Meadows, Emily Perkins, Crystal Macdonald, Kristen Nguyen, Janet Leonard, Todd Christensen, Cindy Lang, Melanie Nash, Kevin Klein, Mark Johnson, Timothy Hill, Omar Estrada, Regina Brewer, Lori Rodriguez.\n   - Friendship connections: (Given)\n   - Maximum Independent Set: [Kyle Austin, Kimberly Foster, Crystal Macdonald, Kristen Nguyen, Melanie Nash, Mark Johnson, Timothy Hill, Regina Brewer].\n\nBy applying the algorithm described above, the Maximum Independent Set for the given social network is [Kyle Austin, Kimberly Foster, Crystal Macdonald, Kristen Nguyen, Melanie Nash, Mark Johnson, Timothy Hill, Regina Brewer]."}, "93": {"gpt4": "The Maximum Independent Set of the given social network is [Kathy Palmer, Maureen Thomas, Michelle Sheppard, Patricia Clark, Shannon Ibarra, Johnny Willis, Anthony Lee, Sheri Hickman, Jason Hutchinson]."}, "94": {"gpt4": "To solve the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem, we aim to find the largest subset of users in the social network where no two users are friends connected by an edge. \n\nAnalyzing the provided network:\n\n- **Users**: There are 23 users in the network.\n- **Friendship Connections**: Each pair of users that are connected by an edge represent a friendship connection.\n\nTo identify the Maximum Independent Set, we need to find a subset of users where no two users are connected by an edge.
