The goal is to find the largest subset of users (nodes) such that no two users in this subset are friends (connected by an edge).\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use a brute-force approach by checking all possible subsets of users and finding the largest subset where no two users are friends. However, this approach has exponential time complexity.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a more efficient algorithm, such as a greedy algorithm or a graph coloring algorithm, to find an approximate solution. These algorithms have polynomial time complexity but may not always find the optimal solution.\n\nIn this particular problem, we can use the following approach to find a Maximum Independent Set:\n\n1. Observe that there are 5 users who are not friends with any other user: Amy Robinson, Maureen Thomas, Patricia Clark, Shannon Ibarra, and Johnny Willis. Add these users to the MIS.\n2.
