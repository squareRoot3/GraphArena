However, this method does not guarantee an optimal solution and can sometimes yield poor results.\n\nAnother approach is to use a more sophisticated algorithm like the Held-Karp algorithm, which provides an exact solution for the TSP but is still polynomial in the number of cities. For larger instances, approximation algorithms like Christofides' algorithm or various metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing) can be used.\n\nGiven the constraints of this platform, we cannot execute these algorithms directly.
