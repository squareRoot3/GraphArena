Create a complete bipartite graph G(X, Y, E) where X represents atoms of Molecule A, Y represents atoms of Molecule B, and E represents the set of edges with weights as the initial edit distance. The weight of each edge is 1, as the identity cost is 1 for adding or deleting an edge, adding or deleting an isolated node, or relabeling a node.\n\n2. Initialize the cost matrix C, where C[i][j] represents the minimum cost to transform the subgraph A[0...i-1] to the subgraph B[0...j-1]. Set C[0][0] to 0, and for i or j equal to 0, set C[i][j] to i*j as that would be the cost to delete/insert all nodes in one molecule.\n\n3. Fill in the cost matrix C using dynamic programming. For each i and j, consider the last atom in both subgraphs A[i-1] and B[j-1]. If their labels match, then C[i][j] = C[i-1][j-1]. Otherwise, C[i][j] = min(C[i-1][j], C[i][j-1], C[i-1][j-1]) + 1.\n\n4. After filling the cost matrix C, the cost at C[m][n] (where m and n are the total number of atoms in Molecule A and B respectively) will be the Graph Edit Distance.\n\n5. To find the optimal node mapping, we need to backtrack from C[m][n] to C[0][0] while storing the previous node mappings. During backtracking, if the minimum cost is from the diagonal (i.e., C[i-1][j-1]), then the current atom from Molecule A maps to the current atom from Molecule B. If the minimum cost is from the left (i.e., C[i][j-1]), then the current atom from Molecule A is deleted (mapped to a new node not present in Molecule B). If the minimum cost is from the top (i.e., C[i-1]"}}
