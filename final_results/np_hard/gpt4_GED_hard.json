We can then populate this matrix iteratively, considering all possible edit operations at each step.\n\nFor example, considering the provided molecules:\n\nMolecule A:\n- Atoms: C (atom 0), C (atom 1), C (atom 2), N (atom 3), C (atom 4), Cl (atom 5), C (atom 6), N (atom 7), C (atom 8), N (atom 9).\n- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 2-8, 3-4, 4-5, 4-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9.\n\nMolecule B:\n- Atoms: O (atom 0), O (atom 1), C (atom 2), C (atom 3), C (atom 4), C (atom 5), C (atom 6), C (atom 7), C (atom 8), O (atom 9).\n- Bonds: 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 3-8, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 7-9.\n\nWe can start by defining a cost function for each edit operation, such as:\n- Cost of deleting an edge: 1\n- Cost of adding an edge: 1\n- Cost of deleting an isolated node: 1\n- Cost of adding an isolated node: 1\n- Cost of relabeling a node: 1\n\nThen, we can construct the cost matrix and apply dynamic programming to find the minimum edit cost. Once we have the minimum edit cost, we can backtrack to determine the optimal node mapping.\n\n[The optimal node mapping for the given molecules can be represented as a list of integers, where the position in the list corresponds to the atom ID in Molecule A and the value at that position indicates the corresponding atom ID in Molecule B.

We can use various metrics to measure similarity, such as the structural properties of atoms and their connectivity within the molecules.\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the following cost metrics:\n- If two atoms have the same element type, the cost is 0 (indicating no edit is needed).\n- If two atoms have different element types, the cost is 1 (indicating a relabeling operation is required).\n- If an atom exists in one molecule but not the other, the cost is 1 (indicating an addition or deletion operation).\n\nBased on these metrics, we can construct the cost matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost Matrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nEach element in the matrix represents the cost of transforming an atom from Molecule A to an atom in Molecule B, as per the defined metrics.\n\nNext, we apply the Hungarian algorithm to find the optimal node mapping based on this cost matrix. After applying the algorithm, we obtain the optimal mapping of atoms from Molecule A to Molecule B.\n\nThe resulting optimal node mapping will be represented as a list of integers, where the position
