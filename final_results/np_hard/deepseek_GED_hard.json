Here's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify Corresponding Atoms**: First, we need to find a mapping that minimizes the cost of relabeling atoms. Since the cost of relabeling is identity, we look for direct matches in atom types between Molecule A and Molecule B.\n\n2. **Analyze Bonds**: Next, we check the bonds to ensure that the structural integrity is maintained after the mapping. This involves checking if the bonds in Molecule A correspond to valid bonds in Molecule B after applying the mapping.\n\n3. **Calculate Edit Operations**: We calculate the necessary edit operations (adding or deleting edges, adding or deleting isolated nodes) to transform Molecule A into Molecule B based on the identified mapping.\n\n4. **Optimize the Mapping**: We iterate through different mappings to find the one that minimizes the total edit cost.\n\nGiven the complexity of the molecules, a brute-force approach to try all possible mappings is computationally expensive. However, for the purpose of this example, we can attempt to find a reasonable mapping by manually inspecting the structures:\n\n- **Atom Mapping**: We can start by matching atoms of the same type. For example, atom 0 (O) in Molecule A can be matched with atom 0 (O) in Molecule B. Similarly, atom 1 (C) in Molecule A can be matched with atom 1 (C) in Molecule B, and so on.\n\n- **Bond Analysis**: After mapping the atoms, we check the bonds. For instance, the bond between atoms 0 and 1 in Molecule A (O-C) corresponds to the bond between atoms 0 and 1 in Molecule B (O-C).\n\n- **Adjustments**: We may need to adjust the mapping based on bond connectivity.
